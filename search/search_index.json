In this case, the application was Zinc metal batteries for the purposes of storing renewable energies such as solar, wind and the ocean. The article written by Christa Lest\u00e9-Lasserre summarizes the scientific paper and demonstration conducted by Meiling Wu, Ye Zhang, Lin Xu, Chunpeng Yang, Min Hong, Mingjin Cui, Bryson C. Clifford, Shuaiming He, Shuangshuang Jing, Yan Yao, and Liangbing Hu. After initially reading it, I thought about how versatile chitosan is as an extracted material. However, new discoveries of chitin\u2019s material properties makes me wonder how armored or protected crustecaeans are. Do these creatures benefit from these properties as well? Is there more that could be learned from their nature that could help us understand our relationship at a macro level? Prior to reading through the scientific paper the article referenced, I needed to undstand how batteries worked. I learned that \u201cA battery is a device that is able to store electrical energy in the form of chemical energy, and convert that energy into electricity\u201d and \u201cYou cannot catch and store electricity, but you can store electrical energy in the chemicals inside a battery.\u201d - MIT Department of Material Science Technology and Engineering. \u201cA sustainable chitosan-zinc electrolyte for high-rate zinc-metal batteries\u201d Zinc metal batteries are an alternative to lithium ion batteries. They are safe, fast charging, eco-friendly, widely available and low costing. However, they\u2019re not commercialized due to corrosion and common battery failure. These issues stem from the unregulated Zn-deposition morphology at high current densities as well as the high free-water content in conventional electrolytes, which reacts with the Zn-metal during electrochemical cycling. To address the challenges, efforts have been devoted to modifying the electrolyte. In this work, the researchers demonstrate a biopolymeric chitosan-Zn gel electrolyte for high-rate and long-life Zn-metal batteries that features a strong combination of high ionic con- ductivity, mechanical strength, and sustainability while also enabling a desirable deposition morphology of parallel hexagonal Zn platelets (rather than Zn dendrites) on the anode surface. Material fabrication and characterization \u00b6 Membrane: 1. Cast the chitosan solution (4 wt % chitosan in 4 wt % acetic acid aqueous solution) on a PET plastic support. Then, immediately immersed it into a Zn^2+ -saturated NaOH solution (0.6 wt % Zn^2+) to obtain the chitosan-Zn membrane. 2. Rinsed the membrane with water until the pH of the washing solution was 7, followed by mechanically pressing at a pressure of ~5 MPa to produce the final densified chitosan-Zn membrane. Electrolyte: The porous chitosan-Zn membrane was immersed in 2 M ZnSO4 aqueous solution overnight and then pressed at 5 MPa to densify the membrane. The resulting chito- san-Zn electrolyte was then obtained after wiping excess ZnSO4 solution off the surface of the densified membrane with a mass of m0. Conductivity and Zn electrodeposition behavior \u00b6 The paper states that they \u201cfound the chitosan-Zn membrane serves as an excellent Zn2+ electrolyte with a high Zn2+ ionic conductivity and advantageous Zn plating behavior.Using the chitosan-Zn electrolyte with 57% water content, the cell shows a Coulombic ef- ficiency of $99.5% after 100 cycles, indicating excellent Zn plating/stripping reversibility. The chitosan-Zn electrolyte with a lower water content of 34% showed a low Coulombic efficiency of <2% and the chitosan-Zn elec- trolyte with more water (72%) showed a Coulombic efficiency of <99% in the first ten cycles but then significantly fluctuated over subsequent cycles, showing a poor reversibility.\u201d Electrochemical performance \u00b6 With the chitosan-Zn electrolyte, they achieved excellent cycling performance and long lifespan in symmetric Zn-metal batteries at high current densities Non-flammability and biodegradability \u00b6 The chitosan-Zn electrolyte is a gel solution that only shrinks and becomes soft when placed in a flame. Components such as the chitosan polymer and the make the electrolyte non-flammable which ensures the high safety of the Zn-metal batteries. To test its biodegradability, the chitosan-Zn electrolyte was placed in soil and after two months, the gel started to degrade. After 5 months, the gel completely degraded. Reflections \u00b6 This paper gave me an example of how chitosan can be used for electrical purposes. I have an interest in anolog synthesizers and 3D printers that are powered by the sun and I think this paper could be a reference point for how to store solar energy with natural materials such as chitosan and zinc.","title":"BioAgri"},{"location":"term1/03-BioAgri/#biology-agri-0","text":"After discovering the article \u201cBattery made of crab shell and zinc is rechargeable and biodegradable\u201d in the NewScientist, I was intrigued by yet another application chitin/chitosan can be used for.

We were asked to bring scraps of material from our homes that could be used to build an artifact that would live with then share our experience. Also, we were asked to create a challenge for ourselves to move from design speculation to fully immersing ourselves into the design process. Artifact Workshop \u00b6 Upon arrival to Barcelona, I found it hard to find foods that I enjoyed and when I started going to the grocery stores, my partner and I noticed how difficult it was to find the right spices and ingredients needed to make our favorite dishes. The only way of adapting to this specific issue was to be creative, experimental and improvisatory in the kitchen. When I was thinking of this specific problem, I also thought about what my ancestors ate with the available resources they had in their time and location. If only I can communicate with them and ask their what their recipes were and what alternative ingredients could be used to honor their dishes. In return, I would provide them an offering of the food they would loved to eat. An ancestral communication device that I know of is the African Mask. In many African cultures, the African mask can symbolize a spirit or an ancestor and is used in ritual to talk to them. With the scraps and materials from the artifact workshop, I created an African mask that embodied an ancestor that would help me cook foods in a foriegn location. The Challenge \u00b6 I challenged myself to live 24hrs off of the stardard time grid. Apart of colonization and industrialization, a concept of time zones were created and \u201cglobally\u201d agreed upon by exclusively first world nations. Their concept of time is to this day rooted in productivity, extraction and linear progression. After studying the works of Rashida Phillips and being apart of the Black Quantum Futurism: Time Zone Protocols unconference, I learned about the origins of western time constructs and how it deeply impacts marginalized Black communities in the United States. In this challenge, I wanted to ask my self, \u201cWhat insights can be drawn when off of the time grid? What does this vanatge point show us in regards of decolonizing design. My intention is to create multipurpose artifacts that are in deep relationship with the earth and other non-human being. These artifacts would lead circular lives that are in rhythm with the earth. In order to understand these ciclic, natural rhythms, I needed to remove myself from \u201cwestern\u201d conceptions of time. As far as the challenge it self, I woke up naturally with no alarm and I got to witness the sun rise. The sun rise provided me with an understanding that time had past and the day is starting. That morning, I ate breakfastt with my partner who is operating on the time grid. This is very important because our relationship is also a representation of time passing. Then we went to the park and I got to practice stillness with the non-human life that surrounded me. I was able to notice patterns of the wind indicating rain was coming. I noticed the rhythms of the birds, the trees, the insects who seemed to be preparing for the storm. In doing this, I felt fully immersed in the natural patterns of the environment. After a while, this immersiion altered my perceptiion of time and I confirmed this with my partner. She wouuld ask me how much time I thought passed by and I was slightly off. Initially, she asked me how much time went by and I said 20 minutes but in actuality it had been 27 minutes. This was indicating that I was slowly leaving the time grid even with a short amount of time that passed. To get an accurate answer to my initial question, I would need to leave the time grid for more than 24hrs. I would say several weeks off the grid would allow me to conceptualize the potential of design with a new meaning of time.

For the last few years, I have struggled to start or be apart of a group of people that have organic relationships who share knowledge, resources and experiences. It has been a struggle that can be partially blamed by covid but also finding like minds that have similar values to me. During this community engagement week, there was a session where a fellow collegue experienced what I recognize as being outcasted for speaking their truth. I beleive this truth was not welcomed because of how greatly it challenges the existing structures. I was not physically there to witness the incident but I feel that I didn\u2019t need to be to understand the feeling knowing how much my people experience this throughout history. I was asked to by the fellow collegue to join them in a meeting with the head of Academics to discuss what ways the institution can do better in these scenarios. In this very meeting I believe there was one thing that I feel I was wrong for saying. I suggested that the staff should be more diverse. I slightly disagree with that statement because I never want to join a community and immediately change the people within it especially if I am outsider who hasn\u2019t had communal responsibilies yet. However, I am glad I said that the staff of the institution needs to be more self aware of who they are in relationship to who the students are. To be self-aware is to also be open to understanding other ways of knowing. It is not an easy task. It takes personal, historical and ancestral research and it challenges someone to look at who they are outside of a system or community that was designed for them.","title":"Community Engagement"},{"location":"term1/06-Community%20Engagement/#community-engagement","text":"As someone who is seeking community, I am constantly redifining what the true essence of what it means to be apart of one. For the last few years, I have struggled to start or be apart of a group of people that have organic relationships who share knowledge, resources and experiences. It has been a struggle that can be partially blamed by covid but also finding like minds that have similar values to me. During this community engagement week, there was a session where a fellow collegue experienced what I recognize as being outcasted for speaking their truth. I beleive this truth was not welcomed because of how greatly it challenges the existing structures.

I came into this topic hoping to have more open dialog on ethical practices with AI but I still learned different approaches of designing with AI that consider a multitude of relationships it has in the real world. I really enjoyed the exercise where we played the role of our speculative AI agent. Our agent was a Crystal Ball that interprets dreams as images and predicts the future based on a collective dataset of dreams. I acted as the crystal ball and my group mates interviewed me with questions that helped understand the intentions of the agent. An example of a question would be - Do you have dreams of your own? How do you value dreams? Are the dreams in the collective dataset anonymous? These questions were gateways to discussing the ethics behind the agent and finding areas of this system that could potentially exploit the lives of the users. One area that was quite interesting with this agent is the measurement of accuracy. How would the crystal ball know if a future eventually played out the way it predicted it? And, what does these measurements say about augmented systems predicting the future? Even though I would have liked to see examples of AI used in ethical practices and had more dialog around this topic, I found myself exploring a design excercise that would aid me in the future if I ever end up working with artificial intelligence.","title":"Extended Intelligences"},{"location":"term1/07-Extended%20Intelligences/#extended-intelligences","text":"During these two weeks I got to look at Artificial Intelligence from a different perspective.

I enjoyed the lecture knowing that this information is very useful for my exploration with electronics. After creating the Plant Band with Amanda, I felt a litte more confident in working with arduino hardware. Most of these arduino projects are interesting and it makes me wish I were playing with this technology as a kid. I actually want my children to build their toys using raspberry pi, arduino and adafruit devices. How could I communicate the importance of these electronics back to my community? I think about how these skills do not necissarily get you the comfy tech job that a lot of people seek for. Though, these skills are valuable in the sense that they expand creativity and the ability to problem solve. Currently, open-source technology is an extention of white-privelge. We have to think about how accessible these technologies are to all parts of the world. If they are not accessible, there is an implied \u201cresponsibility\u201d for oppressed people to \u201cpull themselves up by their bootstraps\u201d to have access to these tools.

First Challenge \u00b6 I am currently building another midi controller for plants using the esp32 so I used Amanda\u2019s Adafruit Circuit Playground Express for the challenge. Luckily, the board has a built-in buzzer and the board\u2019s library comes with tone features. There was a tutorial that I found that maps a music note to a number and so I could create any pattern I wanted. The tutorial\u2019s pattern was that of the Happy Birthday Song. I decided to re-arrange the pattern to play the Happy Birthday Song by Stevie Wonder.","title":"Prototyping for Design"},{"location":"term2/Prototyping%20For%20Design/#prototyping-for-design","text":"","title":"Prototyping for Design"},{"location":"term2/Prototyping%20For%20Design/#week-1-class-1-introduction-buzzer-challenge","text":"I was not expecting to learn more about arduino micro-controllers during the Remixing of Materials week but I believe everything has a connection.
