# Prototyping for Design

## Week 1 - Class 1 - Introduction & Buzzer Challenge

I was not expecting to learn more about arduino micro-controllers during the Remixing of Materials week but I believe everything has a connection. I enjoyed the lecture knowing that this information is very useful for my exploration with electronics. After creating the Plant Band with Amanda, I felt a litte more confident in working with arduino hardware. Most of these arduino projects are interesting and it makes me wish I were playing with this technology as a kid. I actually want my children to build their toys using raspberry pi, arduino and adafruit devices. 

How could I communicate the importance of these electronics back to my community? I think about how these skills do not necissarily get you the comfy tech job that a lot of people seek for. Though, these skills are valuable in the sense that they expand creativity and the ability to problem solve. Currently, open-source technology is an extention of white-privelge. We have to think about how accessible these technologies are to all parts of the world. If they are not accessible, there is an implied "responsibility" for oppressed people to "pull themselves up by their bootstraps" to have access to these tools. I think that when we create open-source technology, we need to be more concious about it's impact and who is excluded. 


## First Challenge

I am currently building another midi controller for plants using the esp32 so I used Amanda's Adafruit Circuit Playground Express for the challenge. Luckily, the board has a built-in buzzer and the board's library comes with tone features. There was a tutorial that I found that maps a music note to a number and so I could create any pattern I wanted. The tutorial's pattern was that of the Happy Birthday Song. I decided to re-arrange the pattern to play the Happy Birthday Song by Stevie Wonder.
