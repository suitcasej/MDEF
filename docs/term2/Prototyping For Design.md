# Prototyping for Design

## Week 1 - Class 1 - Introduction & Buzzer Challenge

I was not expecting to learn more about arduino micro-controllers during the Remixing of Materials week but I believe everything has a connection. I enjoyed the lecture knowing that this information is very useful for my exploration with electronics. After creating the Plant Band with Amanda, I felt a litte more confident in working with arduino hardware. Most of these arduino projects are interesting and it makes me wish I were playing with this technology as a kid. I actually want my children to build their toys using raspberry pi, arduino and adafruit devices. 

How could I communicate the importance of these electronics back to my community? I think about how these skills do not necissarily get you the comfy tech job that a lot of people seek for. Though, these skills are valuable in the sense that they expand creativity and the ability to problem solve. Currently, open-source technology is an extention of white-privelge. We have to think about how accessible these technologies are to all parts of the world. If they are not accessible, there is an implied "responsibility" for oppressed people to "pull themselves up by their bootstraps" to have access to these tools. I think that when we create open-source technology, we need to be more concious about it's impact and who is excluded. 


## First Challenge

I am currently building another midi controller for plants using the esp32 so I used Amanda's Adafruit Circuit Playground Express for the challenge. Luckily, the board has a built-in buzzer and the board's library comes with tone features. There was a tutorial that I found that maps a music note to a number and so I could create any pattern I wanted. The tutorial's pattern was that of the Happy Birthday Song. I decided to re-arrange the pattern to play the Happy Birthday Song by Stevie Wonder. 


## Week 1 Class 2 - Parameterization

What initally attracted me to Iaac was the interesting parametric designs the students produce each year. I immediately wanted to know how I could learn to create these complex geometries as well. I wasn't able to attend class this day but my colleagues filled me in on what was learned. I have the Advanced 3D Printing with Grasshopper Book by Diego Garcia Cuevas and Gianluca Pugliese so I thought it would be the perfect time to learn how to create a shape. I created the shape that is on the cover of the book. It is a popular shape within the clay 3D printing space but I was always intimidated by how it was created. Doing this exercise gave me a boost of confidence in using Rhino and Grasshopper. I have used the tools before but I never got comfortable with using it yet.
