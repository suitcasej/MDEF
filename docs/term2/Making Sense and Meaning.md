## STOLEN FUTURE - How to re-design a future that was stolen from Indigenous nations.

From the depths of colonialism and the legacy of enslavement to the current global economic order, Indigenous communities around the world have been subjected to relentless exploitation, their rich cultural heritage stripped away and their abundant futures stripped for the benefit of external powers. In the pursuit of liberation and justice, this exploration draws upon the tenets of decentralization, circular economies, and examples of the visionaries among idigenous communities laying down the ground work for their people. By interrogating the existing structures of power, this article seeks to envision a future that breaks free from the chains of cultural exploitation and environmental degradation, enabling communities to reclaim their identities, protect their heritage, and chart their own destinies.

Decentralization: Reclaiming Power and Autonomy:
Decentralization stands as a transformative paradigm that challenges the dominant systems of control and exploitation. By redistributing power, resources, and decision-making authority, decentralized systems empower communities to dismantle oppressive structures and reclaim their agency. Traditional power structures have perpetuated the marginalization and disenfranchisement of African communities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and cultural erasure. However, decentralization offers a path toward self-determination, economic autonomy, and cultural sovereignty. Through collective action and participatory governance, marginalized communities can cultivate sustainable development models that disrupt the insidious cycle of extraction and profit-seeking.

Circular Economies: Restoring Harmony between Humans and the Environment:
The adoption of circular economy principles offers a radical departure from the unsustainable practices that have ravaged African communities and the natural world. Traditionally, African societies maintained a deep reverence for the environment, recognizing the interconnectedness between humans and nature. However, the imposition of exploitative economic systems disrupted this delicate balance, leading to environmental degradation and loss of cultural heritage. Circular economies prioritize the notions of reuse, recycling, and regeneration, providing a blueprint for sustainable development and environmental justice. By merging traditional wisdom with modern innovation, circular economies offer a pathway to honor our ancestors, protect our ecosystems, and nurture cultural heritage while promoting economic prosperity.

Francis Kere: Architectural Revival and Cultural Preservation:
Francis Kere, an eminent architect from Burkina Faso, embodies the spirit of architectural revival and cultural preservation. His visionary designs, deeply rooted in the indigenous traditions of his homeland, demonstrate the possibility of blending modernity with cultural authenticity. Kere's architectural projects serve as symbols of resistance against cultural erasure, incorporating sustainable materials, community involvement, and innovative design principles. By drawing inspiration from Kere's work, we can reimagine future systems that celebrate cultural diversity, promote inclusivity, and prioritize the preservation of local knowledge and practices. Through sustainable and culturally sensitive architectural design, African communities can reclaim their identity and foster spaces that reflect their values and aspirations.

Preserving Cultural Heritage: Community Data Centers:
In an era of rampant globalization and digital connectivity, the protection and preservation of cultural heritage are paramount. The digital age has facilitated the rapid dissemination and commodification of cultural artifacts, leaving African communities vulnerable to exploitation and misappropriation. Community data centers emerge as crucial institutions for safeguarding our collective history, language, and data from predatory practices. These centers serve as repositories of cultural wealth, facilitating the digitization, conservation, and ownership of artifacts, records, and narratives. By establishing community-controlled data centers, nations can reclaim their narratives, assert sovereignty over their intellectual property, and prevent the continued plundering of their cultural resources. Furthermore, these centers can provide access to information and resources for future generations, empowering them to reconnect with their heritage and contribute to its preservation.

Michael Running Wolf: AI for Indigenous Language Preservation:
Language serves as a fundamental pillar of cultural identity, transmitting knowledge, values, and ways of knowing from one generation to another. Yet, indigenous languages across Africa face the threat of extinction due to the pressures of globalization and the dominance of colonial languages. Michael Running Wolf's pioneering research in utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) for indigenous language preservation represents a powerful tool in the fight against cultural erasure. By harnessing the potential of AI, Running Wolf's work seeks to bridge the technological divide, enabling the documentation and revitalization of indigenous languages. By incorporating indigenous knowledge systems into AI technologies, communities can preserve and protect their languages, reinforcing cultural pride and reclaiming linguistic sovereignty.

Conclusion:
The design of future systems must be guided by principles that transcend the exploitative dynamics of cultural extraction, environmental degradation, and profit-seeking. By embracing decentralization, circular economies, and the visionary insights of Francis Kere and Michael Running Wolf, Indigenous communities can reclaim their power, protect their heritage, and take back their futures. Through decentralized governance, economic autonomy, sustainable practices, and the preservation of cultural heritage, communities can break free from the chains of exploitation, reclaim their identities, and build a future that prioritizes cultural sovereignty, environmental justice, and sustainable development. The time for action is now, as we strive for a world that upholds the dignity and self-determination of all peoples and embraces the profound wisdom and beauty of African cultures.
