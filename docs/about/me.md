# About

![](../images/MT01/maskAvatar.jpg)

I am a multidisciplinary artist exploring technology at the intersection of ecology, innovation and system design. I believe that technology is at itâ€™s greatest strength when it advances in harmony with our environment. Throughout these next 9 months, I hope to challenge myself to become an effective communicator and a more collaborative designer. This MDEF track will be a stage for me to express my ideas and a space to recieve feedback on my vision. Along this process, I intend to make connections with people that have similar visions, ideas, and stories.
