# Community Engagement

As someone who is seeking community, I am constantly redifining what the true essence of what it means to be apart of one. For the last few years, I have struggled to start or be apart of a group of people that have organic relationships who share knowledge, resources and experiences. It has been a struggle that can be partially blamed by covid but also finding like minds that have similar values to me. 

During this community engagement week, there was a session where a fellow collegue experienced what I recognize as being outcasted for speaking their truth. I beleive this truth was not welcomed because of how greatly it challenges the existing structures. I was not physically there to witness the incident but I feel that I didn't need to be to understand the feeling knowing how much my people experience this throughout history. I was asked to by the fellow collegue to join them in a meeting with the head of Academics to discuss what ways the institution can do better in these scenarios. In this very meeting I believe there was one thing that I feel I was wrong for saying. I suggested that the staff should be more diverse. I slightly disagree with that statement because I never want to join a community and immediately change the people within it especially if I am outsider who hasn't had communal responsibilies yet. However, I am glad I said that the staff of the institution needs to be more self aware of who they are in relationship to who the students are. To be self-aware is to also be open to understanding other ways of knowing. It is not an easy task. It takes personal, historical and ancestral research. It challenges someone to look at who they are outside of a system or community that was designed for them.
