# Living With Your Own Ideas

In this week, I was still adjusting and adapting to how MDEF operates and I have to admit that my creative juices were not flowing the way I wanted it to. We were asked to bring scraps of material from our homes that could be used to build an artifact that would live with then share our experience. Also, we were asked to create a challenge for ourselves to move from design speculation to fully immersing ourselves into the design process. 


## Artifact Workshop
Upon arrival to Barcelona, I found it hard to find foods that I enjoyed and when I started going to the grocery stores, my partner and I noticed how difficult it was to find the right spices and ingredients needed to make our favorite dishes. The only way of adapting to this specific issue was to be creative, experimental and improvisatory in the kitchen. When I was thinking of this specific problem, I also thought about what my ancestors ate with the available resources they had in their time and location. If only I can communicate with them and ask their what their recipes were and what alternative ingredients could be used to honor their dishes. In return, I would provide them an offering of the food they would loved to eat. An ancestral communication device that I know of is the African Mask. In many African cultures, the African mask can symbolize a spirit or an ancestor and is used in ritual to talk to them. With the scraps and materials from the artifact workshop, I created an African mask that embodied an ancestor that would help me cook foods in a foriegn location.

## The Challenge
I challenged myself to live 24hrs off of the stardard time grid. Apart of colonization and industrialization, a concept of time zones were created and "globally" agreed upon by exclusively first world nations. Their concept of time is to this day rooted in productivity, extraction and linear progression. After studying the works of Rashida Phillips and being apart of the [Black Quantum Futurism: Time Zone Protocols](https://www.blackquantumfuturism.com/event-details/black-quantum-futurism-time-zone-protocols#:~:text=Time%20Zone%20Protocols%20aims%20to,the%20past%20and%20present%20while) unconference, I learned about the origins of western time constructs and how it deeply impacts marginalized Black communities in the United States. In this challenge, I wanted to ask my self, "What insights can be drawn when off of the time grid? What does this vanatge point show us in regards of decolonizing design. My intention is to create multipurpose artifacts that are in deep relationship with the earth and other non-human being. These artifacts would lead circular lives that are in rhythm with the earth. In order to understand these ciclic, natural rhythms, I needed to remove myself from "western" conceptions of time. 

As far as the challenge it self, I woke up naturally with no alarm and I got to witness the sun rise. The sun rise provided me with an understanding that time had past and the day is starting. That morning, I ate breakfastt with my partner who is operating on the time grid. This is very important because our relationship is also a representation of time passing. Then we went to the park and I got to practice stillness with the non-human life that surrounded me. I was able to notice patterns of the wind indicating rain was coming. I noticed the rhythms of the birds, the trees, the insects who seemed to be preparing for the storm. In doing this, I felt fully immersed in the natural patterns of the environment. After a while, this immersiion altered my perceptiion of time and I confirmed this with my partner. She wouuld ask me how much time I thought passed by and I was slightly off. Initially, she asked me how much time went by and I said 20 minutes but in actuality it had been 27 minutes. This was indicating that I was slowly leaving the time grid even with a short amount of time that passed.

To get an accurate answer to my initial question, I would need to leave the time grid for more than 24hrs. I would say several weeks off the grid would allow me to conceptualize the potential of design with a new meaning of time.
