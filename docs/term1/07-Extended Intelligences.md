# Extended Intelligences

During these two weeks I got to look at Artificial Intelligence from a different perspective. I came into this topic hoping to have more open dialog on ethical practices with AI but I still learned different approaches of designing with AI that consider a multitude of relationships it has in the real world. I really enjoyed the exercise where we played the role of our speculative AI agent. Our agent was a Crystal Ball that interprets dreams as images and predicts the future based on a collective dataset of dreams. I acted as the crystal ball and my group mates interviewed me with questions that helped understand the intentions of the agent. An example of a question would be - Do you have dreams of your own? How do you value dreams? Are the dreams in the collective dataset anonymous? These questions were gateways to discussing the ethics behind the agent and finding areas of this system that could potentially exploit the lives of the users. One area that was quite interesting with this agent is the measurement of accuracy. How would the crystal ball know if a future eventually played out the way it predicted it? And, what does these measurements say about augmented systems predicting the future? 

Even though I would have liked to see examples of AI used in ethical practices and had more dialog around this topic, I found myself exploring a design excercise that would aid me in the future if I ever end up working with artificial intelligence.
