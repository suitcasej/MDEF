# My Fight Poster

My vision is to build communal relationships with our environment to design systems and structures that are physically and metaphysically healthy for all beings. I aim to enable artists, designers, makers, agriculturalist, and activists of marginalized communities of color with emerging technologies implied by Indigenous knowledge systems. To pilot this vision, I look to research beings that Afro-Indigenous cultures have relationships to and design processes that collaborate with culture, community and the environment.
