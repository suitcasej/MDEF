After discovering the article "Battery made of crab shell and zinc is rechargeable and biodegradable" in the NewScientist, I was intrigued by yet another application chitin/chitosan can be used for. In this case, the application was Zinc metal batteries for the purposes of storing renewable energies such as solar, wind and the ocean. The article written by Christa Lesté-Lasserre summarizes the scientific paper and demonstration conducted by Meiling Wu, Ye Zhang, Lin Xu, Chunpeng Yang, Min Hong, Mingjin Cui, Bryson C. Clifford, Shuaiming He, Shuangshuang Jing, Yan Yao, and Liangbing Hu. After initially reading it, I thought about how versatile chitosan is as an extracted material. However, new discoveries of chitin's material properties makes me wonder how armored or protected crustecaeans are. Do these creatures benefit from these properties as well? Is there more that could be learned from their nature that could help us understand our relationship at a macro level? 

Prior to reading through the scientific paper the article referenced, I needed to undstand how batteries worked. I learned that "A battery is a device that is able to store electrical energy in the form of chemical energy, and convert that energy into electricity" and "You cannot catch and store electricity, but you can store electrical energy in the chemicals inside a battery." - MIT Department of Material Science Technology and Engineering.

"A sustainable chitosan-zinc electrolyte for high-rate zinc-metal batteries"

Zinc metal batteries are an alternative to lithium ion batteries. They are safe, fast charging, eco-friendly, widely available and low costing.  However, they’re not commercialized due to corrosion and common battery failure. These issues stem from the unregulated Zn-deposition morphology at high current densities as well as the high free-water content in conventional electrolytes, which reacts with the Zn-metal during electrochemical cycling. 

To address the challenges, efforts have been devoted to modifying the electrolyte. In this work, the researchers demonstrate a biopolymeric chitosan-Zn gel electrolyte for high-rate and long-life Zn-metal batteries that features a strong combination of high ionic con- ductivity, mechanical strength, and sustainability while also enabling a desirable deposition morphology of parallel hexagonal Zn platelets (rather than Zn dendrites) on the anode surface.

Material fabrication and characterization

Membrane:
1. Cast the chitosan solution (4 wt % chitosan in 4 wt % acetic acid aqueous solution) on a PET plastic support. Then, immediately immersed it into a Zn^2+ -saturated NaOH solution (0.6 wt % Zn^2+) to obtain the chitosan-Zn membrane.
2. Rinsed the membrane with water until the pH of the washing solution was 7, followed by mechanically pressing at a pressure of ~5 MPa to produce the final densified chitosan-Zn membrane.

Electrolyte:
The porous chitosan-Zn membrane was immersed in 2 M ZnSO4 aqueous solution overnight and then pressed at 5 MPa to densify the membrane. The resulting chito- san-Zn electrolyte was then obtained after wiping excess ZnSO4 solution off the surface of the densified membrane with a mass of m0.

Conductivity and Zn electrodeposition behavior

The paper states that they "found the chitosan-Zn membrane serves as an excellent Zn2+ electrolyte with a high Zn2+ ionic conductivity and advantageous Zn plating behavior.Using the chitosan-Zn electrolyte with 57% water content, the cell shows a Coulombic ef- ficiency of $99.5% after 100 cycles, indicating excellent Zn plating/stripping reversibility. The chitosan-Zn electrolyte with a lower water content of 34% showed a low Coulombic efficiency of <2% and the chitosan-Zn elec- trolyte with more water (72%) showed a Coulombic efficiency of <99% in the first ten cycles but then significantly fluctuated over subsequent cycles, showing a poor reversibility."

Electrochemical performance

With the chitosan-Zn electrolyte, they achieved excellent cycling performance and long lifespan in symmetric Zn-metal batteries at high current densities

Non-flammability and biodegradability

The chitosan-Zn electrolyte is a gel solution that only shrinks and becomes soft when placed in a flame. Components such as the chitosan polymer and the  make the electrolyte non-flammable which ensures the high safety of the Zn-metal batteries. To test its biodegradability, the chitosan-Zn electrolyte was placed in soil and after two months, the gel started to degrade. After 5 months, the gel completely degraded.

Reflections

This paper gave me an example of how chitosan can be used for electrical purposes. I have an interest in anolog synthesizers and 3D printers that are powered by the sun and I think this paper could be a reference point for how to store solar energy with natural materials such as chitosan and zinc.
